    <h3>Re: Eileen Dover University application</h3>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the university of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="PHD">PHD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h5>Subjects of study:</h5>
    <p>At the Awesome Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into the wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C(86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 X 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
        <li><abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know> Thanks.</p>
    <h5>Exotic dance moves</h5>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian Chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 3000BC, a whole village would dance around their livestock to be "fruitful"</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as means of getting warm, they used to pratice their dance, which imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of me fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
        <dt>Arctic Robot Dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960's believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic" stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however, it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
