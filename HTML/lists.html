    <h3>Quick hummus recipe</h3>
    <p>     This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>
    <p>     Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Can (400g) of chick peas(garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:   </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor.</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time.</li>
        <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>     For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chilli pepper, lime and chiptole, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>
    <h3>Storage:    </h3>
    <p>     Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you have made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>
    <p>     Hummus is suitable for freezing, you should use it within couple of months.</p>
